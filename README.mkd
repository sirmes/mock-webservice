##Very simple and quick to fire up mock server

This code is sipporting SOAP 1.1, but can virtually support any SOAP, WSDL, JSON, etc HTTP mocking needs.

It is totally based on the nodes module [https://github.com/gstroup/apimocker](https://github.com/gstroup/apimocker). Just follow the instructions to get the apimocker set up.

To fire SetAuthorizations it up:

```sh
apimocker --config config.json
```

Test it calling [localhost:7878](http://localhost:7878/SetAuthorizations)
